            My name is Joey, and welcome to my portfolio! 
            <br>
            <br>
            I've had a couple career changes in my life, so you can say that I have a bit of experience everywhere! I originally went to UT Austin and studied Actuarial Science while I was there. After pursuing that major for three years, I realized that Actuary was not something that I wanted to do, and decided to try something I wanted to do.
            <br>
            <br>
            After that, I pursued a Game Design Associates at Lone Star and learned how to code a bit in C#, C++, & Java. With that, I was able to land a job as an apprentice at a company called Cyberdefenses, where I was there for a year and focused mainly on identity management there. Unfortunately, during my time there, covid happened, and I was furloughed and my whole division was let go.
            <br>
            <br>
            During this time, I decided to finish my Bachelors since I never finished it, and went to UH to pursue a Bachelors in Retail & Consumer Science. I ended up getting an internship at a small company named David Peck and worked in their marketing department. At my time there, my responsibilities were to focus on our websites SEO, website functionality, e-mail campaign, & social media. I enjoyed my time there, but realized I wanted to go back into coding, but had not coded for a couple years at this point, so here I am at this bootcamp!
